Andhyodaya Bundled Small Scale Rural Biogas Projects (Phase 1), Kerala (UCR ID Number: 281)
___________
The Andhyodaya Bundled Small Scale Rural Biogas Projects (Phase 1), Kerala is located across many villages in the Districts: Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Idukki, Kannur, Kasaragod, Kollam, Kottayam, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, Pathanamthitta, Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur and Wayanad, State: Kerala, Country: India and setup by the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) – The Andhyodaya (Project Proponent-PP).  Unlike other NGO’s, the PP concentrates in four areas of development activities namely the non-conventional energy promotion, environment sanitation with emphasis on water management, farmers self help groups and low cost building technology. The PP has  undertaken projects and programmes related to the UN SDGs with a focus on rural community development.  

Prior biogas programs (similar but unrelated to this particular UCR project activity) by the PP have generated carbon offsets and bought by leading global financial institutions such as the IFC- World Bank Group (source: IFC Annual Report 2008) to offset the carbon footprint of the IFC global business operations.  IFC considers such projects (which generates no smoke or soot), to have strong community beneﬁts, with a delivery model that enhances the health, safety, and economic well-being of the communities in which such projects operates.

The technology used in this project activity is the household level biogas plants and the owner of the technology is the particular household using biogas plants and the PP who maintains the biogas systems for the liftime of the activity. 

The project activity aims at avoidance of fuel wood (firewood) consumption by traditional stove users by switching to bio-digester (biogas) technology using cow dung as a renewable energy fuel.  The implemented biogas units for cooking needs helps reduce the amount of fuel wood used for cooking and water heating and replaces inefficient traditional cooking stoves with cleaner biogas stoves.
